问"What metrics would you use for the health of GROUPS"  
因为之前代码节省了时间, 我这个问题就狂说，所以才讲到了network analysis.... 牛人云集,一亩三分地
"If we want add a new product to GROUPS, how do we evaluate its impact on the health”. 1point3acres
这个就是ABtesting的东西了，我实话实说自己没有做过ABtesting，所以选择用student T和ANOVA解释如何一步一步建立样本，
比较statistically difference。莫非说实话也减分，除了有医疗和网站背景的，没做过ABtesting很奇怪么。。。

a. Facebook is going to launch the group feature, to get a better connected community, how are you going 
to evaluate the effect of this new product, what KPI you are going to look at?

b. Ok, we launch the product. In FB we have large group and small groups, and we are going to launch a new
feature for only one category, how are going to make recommendation for the PM?

c. What factors you need to consider before whether to launch the product?
