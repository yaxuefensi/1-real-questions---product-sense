There are two types of cars A and B. The number of people in US who use A 


and B are the same. They drive the same distances each month.


Now there are two new technologies, X and Y (of equal cost). 


If apply X, mpg of A would increase from 50 mpg to 75 mpg;


If apply Y, mpg of B would increase from 10 mpg to 11 mpg.



The goal is to decrease the dependence on foreign oil, or to decrease the 


consumption of gasoline. 

Question: which technology would you apply?

Follow up question: after applying the technology of your choice, assume 

there's money available for research on new technology, which car would you 

choose to conduct research on?
